# Plandit
Plandit is a typical Todo Task application but with the ability to create multiple different Todo lists to represent your projects. The application is built using C#, .NET MAUI, and SQLite. The XAML front-end allows for users to press a button that makes the backend launch a popup with input boxes. These inputs are then used to add elements into an SQLite database, through the C# backend. Multiple projects can be worked on at once.
